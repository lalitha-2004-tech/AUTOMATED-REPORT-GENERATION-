*DESCRIPTION*:

*NAME OF THE PROJECT*: AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATION.

Automated report generation with python involves using scripts to create reports from data sources without manual intervention. This often includes extracting data or reads the data from a file, analyzes it and generates a formatted PDF report. Here is a breakdown of the process and tools involved:

 core steps:
 1. Data Extraction: Fetching data from various sources like files like csv, excel.
 2. Data Processing: Cleaning, transforming, and calculating metrics using libraries like pandas.
 3. Report Generation: Creating the report in a PDF format.
 4. Distribution: Sending the report via email or saving it to a specific location.

Libraries and Tools used: 
1. pandas: For data manipulating and analysis. It provides data structures and functions to handle numerical tables and time series data efficiently.
2. Matplotlib or Seaborn: Matplotlib is used in scientific research as a tool for data visualization..
3. FPDF: FPDF is a python library that stands for Free PDF. It allows you to generate PDF files in python without requring any external dependencies. It is particularly used for generating pdf reports, invoices, and other similar documents.
4. csv: CSV files are a versatile and convenient format for storing and exchanging data in python due to their simplicity, compatibility, and ease of processing with python's libraries.

Report formats:
PDF: Using reportlab or converting HTML to PDF.
         By automating report generation, you can save time, reduce errors, and focus on data analysis and decision making.##
